/**
 * A Task to be executed in the background.
 *
 * Create your own Task by subclassing this and overriding {@link #name()} and {@link #runTask}.
 *
 * It is recommended to create top-level classes or <b>static</b> inner classes for your Tasks
 * in order to avoid leaking the outer class (often an <code>Activity</code> or <code>Fragment</code>)
 * while this Task is running.
 *
 * This Task should be executed by running {@link TaskManager#execute} or {@link Loom#execute}.
 *
 * The Task is considered successful if <code>runTask</code> returns, or failed if
 * <code>runTask</code> raises an Exception.
 * The <code>TaskManager</code> will automatically send a {@link SuccessEvent} or {@link FailureEvent}
 * accordingly.
 * You need to create a {@link com.nbarraille.loom.listeners.LoomListener} with a
 * <code>taskName</code> matching this Task's <code>name</code> and register it with the
 * <code>TaskManager</code> to receive those events.
 *
 * You can customize the <code>SuccessEvent</code> and <code>FailureEvent</code> by overriding the
 * {@link #buildSuccessEvent} and/or {@link #buildFailureEvent} methods.
 * The recommended way to do this is to create your own subclasses of <code>SuccessEvent</code>
 * and/or <code>FailureEvent</code>, and have the methods return a new instance of them.
 *
 * This Task can also returns its progress. For this, it is up to you to call {@link #postProgress}
 * from the <code>runTask</code> method. By default, a generic {@link ProgressEvent} will be sent,
 * but you can also customize it by overriding {@link #buildProgressEvent}.
 *
 * By default, Tasks are not cancellable, so that they will not exit in an indefinite state.
 * If you want your Task to be cancellable, you need to override the {@link #isCancellable} method
 * to return <code>true</code>. To make sure your Task cleans up after itself when cancelled, you
 * can override the {@link #onCancelled} method, which will be executed in the same Thread as the
 * <code>runTask</code> method. <code>onCancelled</code> will only be called if the Task has been
 * cancelled <b>after</b> its execution has started.
 *
 * The Task also provides {@link #onSuccess} and {@link #onFailure} callbacks that will be called in
 * the same Thread as the <code>runTask</code> method after the success/failure event is sent.
